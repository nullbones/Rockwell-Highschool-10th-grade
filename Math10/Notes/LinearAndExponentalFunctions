Domain
-Inputs for a function

Discrete Function
-A function where only a set of numbers can be listed such as a whole
 number or a set of intigers. Sequences are Discretete

Continuous Function
-Every value of x is in the domain. We do not use terms like arithmetic or
 geometric for rates of change.

Descrete Function
-Descret function is not continueus
 Example: Putting 3 pennies in a jar a day
          your not constantly putting pennies
          in your putting only a few
          we would graph this in just dots
          because its outputing in bursts
          instead of in a constant flow.

Continuous 
-function Function is constant
 Example: A house putting out water it is 
          Constantly releasing water and never
          stops when this is graphed we use
          a line because it is constantly making water
          instead of in bursts.

Domain
-The left side of your table or the "x"
 this is called your Domain you use in your equation
