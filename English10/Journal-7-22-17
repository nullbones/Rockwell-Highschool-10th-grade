What's the difference between
a biography & an autobiography?
Is it important to record our personal
Stories as we go though life? Why or why not? 


Well a biography is a story of someone's life written by
someone OTHER than the Person being Written about.

An autobiography is a story about yourself Written by
yourself.

Now i think its VERY important to record your personal stories
because Alot of history is lost to time because we dont right it down
if you think about it the only way to really understand someone's feelings
or Thoughts is to 1 Talk to them about it or 2 Read about it.
So if you dont write down your experences and how you felt about it
it will be lost to time.
