Question: If you could choose to have an unlimited amount of
          ether TIME or MONEY, which one would you choose
          and why?

I would have to pick time because if i picked money it would ruin
the economy and hurt more people then me because i choose to not be
selfish... i would pick time, because it seems like theres never enough
of it.. also i feel like picking time is less destructive then money...
