Question: Is it disrespectful to not
put your hand over your heart and/or
stand during the national anthem or
it it just an example of exercising
your american freedoms?

I think it is not dissrespectful because we 
all have the right not not stand or pledge
but i do think it is disrespectful to not 
neel for the flag because neeling is what
soldiers do in war to pay respects to there
fallen brothers, It is our Duty as american citicens
to treat those that have given it all.. even there lifes
to give you the right to not stand. PERIOD thats all i have to say
