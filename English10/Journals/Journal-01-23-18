Question: Would you like to become
successful? why or why not? EXPLAIN!!!
======================================
Well i would not personaly Lie to become 
successful, because its much much easyer
to maintane being successful if you do not 
have to worry about keeping a lie or a story
true, if you are honest about it and gain success
honestly its pretty much impossible to lose that success
instantly, it would be slowly instead of all at once....
also you would not even have to think about "is this going to give away the truth?"
it just comes natrualy to prove the story because you are making the story,
also thats just how capitalism works, you make an honest paycheck and live life
honestly you get honest money and things are truely yours no one can take that. Really
trust me thats what this system was made to do.
