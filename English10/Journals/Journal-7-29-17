Question:
Is bullying a Problem at
Rockwell? Why or Why not?

Well in the year i have been here
at rockwell ive only had to deal with
one Jackass but other than that its a pretty
taimed school. Everyone ive meet has been nice and
inviting or Just did not want to talk at all.
I enjoy it here at rockwell Its DEFINETLY better
than most schools ive been to.
