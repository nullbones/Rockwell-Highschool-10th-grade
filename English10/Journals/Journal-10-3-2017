Question
"Money cant buy happyness." do you 
agree or disagree? why?

well i dont agree because mabie what makes 
you happy or one of the things that make you happy
is an action or a activity that does cost money. 
now the term money cant buy happyness goes to term
that your children are not happy if all you do is buy 
them stuff and thats it. Like you need to be there mom/or dad
