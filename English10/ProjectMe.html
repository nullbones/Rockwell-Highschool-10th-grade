<font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6" style="font-size: 28pt"><b>Chapter
1: Who am I?</b></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%"><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Who
am I. Thats a question I am going to answer. This is a ruff draft so
I am going to kind of ramble off and then I can ALWAYS format it
later and make it look all pretty. Well my name is Connor Jones and I
am in 10<sup>th</sup> grade. Ive been going to rockwell for two years
now. This is my second year now.</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%"><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Now
this stuff is the boring old stuff but its the basic stuff. Ill
finish with that and then we will get to the good stuff that I really
take pride in  about my self. I live with 4 people and two dogs one
of them is really old at the moment and might pass away. So those
four people I was just talking about they consist of my mom, dad,
Brother and sister, The dog’s name’s are Tally(the old one) and
Murphy(my dog) there my family. SO ill just start getting into the
stuff thats really about ME! But! Before then ill talk to you about
the reason why I want to write this in MY words and not just do the
bare minimum and get a grade and move on. Yes this is an ASSIGNMENT
and yes I need to complete it to pass english 10 but I also have a
purpose for this ASSIGNMENT Hopefully your my son, daughter or even
wife, who KNOW’S! You could even be an alien who found this
LOOONNNGGG after the earth I call home is gone.</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%"><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">But
I want to document me onto this Book. You could even think it as Me
printing a copy of my brain on to a peace of paper to live on
forever. No ill ramble off some more. Currently I am listening to 
Need you  by Dillion Francis &amp; nightmare. I also just said that
because Music, Im just going to explain how my brain works some more.
Try and give you a candle to my maze. So I purposely connected my
memories everymoment ive wanted to keep forever or Really enjoyed I
took 15 minutes to listen to 3 songs</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%"><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">now
what that does is it makes ANOTHER bridge for my brain connecting
that memory to that song. My grandmother died from allstimers no ive
als o done that so If I get it to I have a  phyisical connection to
my memories so if I cant recall stuff on my own I can just turn on
some music and have memorites, good memories start flowing to my
head. Its pretty fantastic. So reader there’s one fun fact about my
head. Like now the song Vibration’s	 by Ephwurd just came on now
ill give you an exsample about that song, I listened to that song
when we went camping in our family jeep up at american fork canyon.
Which I really enjoyed and had good memories. Like one thing that
happened there was we layed down a blanket for a picnic and then we
where talking having fun I could smell the tree’s and the cool
brease was running along my cheek. I was laying against the trunk of
the tree it  could feel its hard rough bark against my back. Then
here’s the funny part without noticeing we layed the blanket on top
of a Red ant hill! xD we scrambled to pickup the heavy red cooler
with a white lid and the blankets we rolled up and threw in the back
of the jeep all while holding our sandwiches. Ahhh it was fun. </font></font>

<p style="line-height: 200%"><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Now
I think you are probly on the edge of you seat to hear more about Me
and my Personality.</font></font></p>

<font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Ill
start telling you about me in my OWN words. My name is Connor Jakob
Jones my Parents are Stephanie and Jake Jones. I am in 10<sup>th</sup>
grade and I am a Hacker! I now I wish there was a asccii character to
empisise how proud I am of that name. DONT! Get me confused with this
guy</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%"><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">this
guy look’s like an idiot! xD  I mean like dude thats now how you
lock your computer im sorry man… it just does not work that way.</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%"><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">This
is the media’s ‘<span style="font-weight: normal">laugh’s a few
more times’ </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Picture of a
hacker</span></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%"><img src="ProjectMe_html_d388a6da810f1cd4.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="116" height="78" border="0"/>
<font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">now
most of the general public when you say hacker this DUDE apears in
there head. Its wrong Everthing about it. Using the term hacker is
</span></font></font><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">such
a broad term its almost Insulting to consider it as all around
ILLEGAL now ima explain why its not. First of all ima do the best I
can in my words but some where that explains this MUCH better would
be <a href="http://ir0nin.com/">http://ir0nin.com/</a>  I would
highly advice you to go there but ill explain it in my words. Hacking
is a mindset its a Lifestyle. Hacking is a power its like owning a
gun or a car you can use it for good or for bad now this DUDE! The
one who is VERY confused he is the one that probly is a bad dude he
probly hacks for illegal purpouses ill talk more about my part in the
hacker lifestyle and the culture and the Community but im a Hacker im
a modern Super hero Eveyday our world is become more and more
Dependent on Technology</span></font></font><font face="Cambria"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">
But the more and more we are dependent on it Malicious hackers like
Mr Ul7iM8 H@cK3r up there get more power and its gotten to the point
where getting someone’s password literally gives the person the
power to put them on the street’s  now that is where it  drives me
insane. Its scary. Now I have seen what people can do with a laptop
there’s  a place in Las Vegas Where hacker’s from all over meet
and Share there discovery’s and what they can do That place is
Called DEFCON now I recently came back from Defcon 25 the twenty
fifth Defcon so far </span></font></font>
